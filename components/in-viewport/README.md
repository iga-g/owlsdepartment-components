# InViewport

## Requirements
 - `lodash`
 - `ovee.js`

# Usage example

Basic usage

```html
<div class="img-wrapper">
    <img class="very-big-image" data-in-viewport />
</div>
```

After appearing `InViewport`, `img` with class `very-big-image` will receive class `in-viewport`, when you can add your styles which make your component appear with cool fade or slide in.
